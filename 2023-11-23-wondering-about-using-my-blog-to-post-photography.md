I have been thinking about this for a bit. I recently acquired a couple really solid cameras and lenses, so I have been really leaning into bringing my camera with me everywhere and capturing interesting moments. 

I wonder if I should start posting the best examples of my work here instead of sacrificing quality to post on social media. It's a dilemma for me as I am not and don't want to be a professional photographer, but I still really want to show the shots I get just by virtue of living in San Francisco and also being a hiker and bike tourist.

I don't really have a fully formed thought for this post, I just wanted to ask this aloud because I really struggle with the pressure to post photos.
