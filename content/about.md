### Who am I?

I have been working with technology for nearly 20 years, and have held numerous senior positions in R&D organizations over the past decade. I love technology, breaking things, and challenges. 

### Personal Life

I am a southerner who moved west like a million others like me and settled in San Francisco. I live with my wonderful partner of nine years and a wonderfully fluffy orange cat that we love.

I am an avid cyclist with thousands of touring miles under the belt. I also enjoy hiking and climbing, ham radio, and stargazing as much as I can.
### How can you reach me?

I prefer email, and you can reach me [via e-mail](mailto:me@robertallenhill.com). You can also reach me [@robert](https://rah.social/@robert) on the Fediverse, and at [robert-hill](https://github.com/robert-hill) on GitHub.
