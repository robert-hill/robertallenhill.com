### The Backstory

When I was a very young child, my father had a workstation issued to him from Digital Equipment Corporation that had my favorite toy: a keyboard. This wasn't just any keyboard, it was a great big clicky-clacky keyboard, and if you typed something it didn't like, it would beep at you. This was easily my favorite sound in the world as a toddler. I would beg to play with the "deet-deet," as I called it.

I grew up with and around computers. My family was the first family I knew that had access to BBSs, and later the World Wide Web and the Internet as we now know it. I had my own first computer, a Toshiba T3200 (with a plasma orange screen, full ISA slots, and my very own 9600baud modem!) with a very plush mechanical keyboard. ![Toshiba T3200](/images/keyboard/t3200.jpg) Later, I had a 486DX and a used IBM Model M I purchased from a hamfest in North Carolina. That Model M keyboard went through at least five more computers with me until something changed.

I had always used really heavy duty peripherals, but one day I purchased my first MacBook Pro. I remember buying that sleek 2009 MacBook Pro and being blown away by the trackpad... and the keyboard. It was the first laptop keyboard that I had used since the T3200 that made me actually want to type on it. The backlighting was phenomenal, even if I didn't really need it. It was nice to have, and it *looked* awesome.

Even though I had a very nice Saitek desktop keyboard at the time, itself having a backlight function, I ditched all my old peripherals. My mechanical keyboard was replaced with an Apple Wireless Keyboard, and my trackball was replaced with a first generation Apple Trackpad.

It felt so perfect, so right. Sure, I had to relearn how to type on the extremely shallow low profile keys but, I thought, this was the way all human interface designs were going. Clearly these are superior in some way or someone like Apple wouldn't stop offering traditional mechanical keyboards with higher profile switches and keys.


I *was* right, these low profile "chicklet" keyboards and slick, slim, wireless mice were the way the entire industry would move for most consumer focused devices. Many younger people have never used anything other than touchscreens and low profile laptop-style keyboards. The market has clearly spoken, and the verdict was that bulky was out and *thin is in.*
