For years I really could never understand "alternative" bicycles. You see, I had a *type* when it came to bikes, and my idea of a proper bicycle was one that had large tires, full fenders, racks, and lots and lots of gears. A proper bike had to have drop bars, because otherwise how would you move your hands around to reduce fatigue? A proper bike definitely had a dynamo hub and a good set of lights paired with it.

The past few years have felt like a full on assault on my tastes in bicycles. There are all these 14-20" folding electric bikes now that just look unbelievably goofy with zero thought put to fit. They come complete with 4"+ tires that just look awful to ride, likely impossible to service hinges and other core components, not to mention about as heavy as an actual motorcycle. I understand why these models have become popular. 

I know there are people, especially in the city of San Francisco, for whom these bikes make the difference in a reliable commute to work, helping make them money as a delivery person, and any number of major life improvements these affordable, fast(ish,) motorized bikes have brought with them. 

In my defense I welcome any new rider that is taking part in riding these streets because we win with numbers, and they are driving the much needed infrastructure changes and funding we are finally seeing. However, some of the worst riding behavior, shoddiest looking materials and construction (bordering on unsafe,) and waste have followed in their explosion of popularity.
