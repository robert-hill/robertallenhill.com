### Why do I keep getting top spec machines?

*This* bugs me, and I feel bad for complaining about it. In my career, I have generally been issued laptops that I *flat out will not use to their maximum.* I work on highly automated SaaS apps. I have worked on this type of an application for years. There are lots of dependencies and running a full stack locally just doesn't make sense. I specifically leverage CI/CD tests to report on defects as I develop. It's relatively inexpensive to have GitHub or CircleCI fail my build for the vast majority of my work.

This post is drawn from a recent gripe that I have. I volunteered to be on the team for feedback and assistance in migrating our Intel-based MacOS engineering teams to the `arm64` "Apple Silicon M1" based platforms, which are what most corporate customers have available through FY2022.

My organization has essentially mandated *16" MacBook Pro M1 Pro* laptops to all engineers, regardless of location or Work-From-Home status. This seems short-sighted and I intend to explain why in this post.
