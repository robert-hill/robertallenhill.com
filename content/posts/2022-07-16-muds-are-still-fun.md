I recently started playing [Realms of Dispair](https://www.realmsofdespair.com/), which is a MUD (**M**ulti **U**ser **D**ungeon) and is entirely text-based. I haven't played a MUD or other online text-based game in many years, but a friend at work was reminiscing with me about the old days of the internet and they came up. I was surprised to see how *active* many MUDs are today, with admins that still listen to their community and put out a lot of really great content for their games.

Nothing really to talk about in this post, other than to say that some of the magic of days gone by still lives on due to dedicated people.
